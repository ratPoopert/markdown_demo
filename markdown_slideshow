# An Introduction to Markdown

## Markdown is a plain text markup syntax

* Can be written and viewed in any text editor
* Easy to read
* Easy to learn

---

## Why use Markdown?

* Future-proof
* Custom styling
* Export to multiple formats
* Content oriented

---

## How to Write Markdown

1. Open your preferred plain text editor
2. Save a new file with the `*.md` extension
3. Start writing!

---

## Basic Syntax

* Paragraphs
* Lists
* Inline formatting
* Block formatting

---

### Paragraphs

```
Lines written together are considered to be paragraphs.
You can start a new line and it will be attached to the previous paragraph.

Adding a blank line in between starts a new paragraph.
```

### Unordered Lists

Start unordered list items with a *, -, or +. Add an extra line break when you're done listing items.

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
    + Sub-item 1
    - Sub-item 2
- Item 3
```

* Item 1
* Item 2
    + Sub-item 1
    - Sub-item 2
- Item 3

---

### Ordered Lists

Start ordered lists with a number and a period. Most Mardown processors will autocorrect the numbering if the order is off.

```
1. First item
2. Second item
   1. First sub-item
   3. Skipped sub-item
   2. Third sub-item
3. Third item
```

1. First item
2. Second item
   1. First sub-item
   3. Skipped sub-item
   2. Third sub-item
3. Third item

---

### Inline Formatting

```
This text is _italicized_.
This text is __bold__.
This text has been ~~struck~~.
This text is `code`.
This text is Pi: $Π=3.14159...$ _queue Sarah_
```

This text is _italicized_.
This text is __bold__.
This text has been ~~struck~~.
This text is `code`.
This text is Pi: $Π=3.14159...$

---

### Block Formatting

* Code blocks
* Math blocks
* Quote blocks

---

##### Code Blocks
````
```
public function get_pi() {
    return Sarah::pi_brain();
}
```
````

```
public function get_pi() {
    return Sarah::pi_brain();
}
```
---

### Block Formatting

##### Math

```
$$
y = mx+b 
$$
```

$$
y = mx+b 
$$

#### Quote
