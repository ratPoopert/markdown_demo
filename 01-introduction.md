# Markdown - An Introduction

## What is Markdown?

## Why Should You Care?

## Basic Syntax

### Paragraphs

To write a paragraph, just write text as you normally would. Nothing fancy.

When you're ready to start a new paragraph, just add an extra line after the previous paragraph and get to typing.

### Inline Styling

In the middle of your plain jane paragraph, you can also:

* _italicize_ text with `_single underscores_`
* __bold__ text with `__double underscores__`
* add ~~strikethroughs~~ with `~~double squiggly tildes~~`
* Add nifty inline `monospaced code` with `` `the backtick` ``

Depending on the parser, underlines can be tricky. Luckily they are also commonly used with hyperlinks and should be avoided in regular use. But, if you need to <u>underline</u>, you can with HTML `<u>underline</u>` tags.

### Headings

You can also add a heading hierarchy with the # prefix:

```
# Heading Level 1
## Heading Level 2
### Heading Level 3
```
